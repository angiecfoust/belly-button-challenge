## Project Overview & Output
The goal of this assignment was to create an interactive dashboard using the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. Javascript, D3, and Plotly were used to create two different graphs and to populate demographic information for each sample. In addition, Javascript was used to create a dropdown selector to change the selected sample in order to view the data for all samples included in the dataset.
