## Project Overview & Output
The goal of this assignment was to create an interactive dashboard using the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. Javascript, D3, and Plotly were used to create two different graphs and to populate demographic information for each sample. In addition, Javascript was used to create a dropdown selector to change the selected sample in order to view the data for all samples included in the dataset.

## Project Output
Below are samples of each type of output.

### Demographic Table
D3 was used to read the metadata for each sample in order to produce a demographic table that changes with each selection in the dropdown menu.

### Bar Chart
The data was sorted and sliced to pull the top 10 bacteria for each individual sample, then displayed in a horizontal bar chart.

### Bubble Chart
Data for each sample was used to create a bubble chart. Marker sizes, styles, and colors were determined using the Plotly documentation.
